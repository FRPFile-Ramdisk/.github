# FRPFile Ramdisk

**FRPFile Ramdisk** is a method used to bypass **FRP (Factory Reset Protection)** on Android devices by leveraging a custom **ramdisk** image. FRP is a security feature introduced by Google to prevent unauthorized access to a device after a factory reset. The FRPFile Ramdisk method involves booting the device into a custom recovery environment using a modified ramdisk, which allows access to the device's file system and bypasses FRP restrictions.
