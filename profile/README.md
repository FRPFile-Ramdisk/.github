### **How FRPFile Ramdisk Works**:
1. **Ramdisk**:
   - A ramdisk is a temporary file system used during the boot process of an Android device.
   - By replacing the default ramdisk with a custom one, users can gain access to the device's file system and modify or delete files related to FRP.

2. **Bypassing FRP**:
   - The custom ramdisk allows users to delete the FRP lock files (e.g., `persistent_data_block` or `frp` files) or modify system settings to bypass the FRP lock.
